# Course Description

_In this interactive tutorial, you will learn how to perform sophisticated dplyr techniques to carry out your data manipulation with R. First you will master the five verbs of R data manipulation with dplyr: select, mutate, filter, arrange and summarise. Next, you will learn how you can chain your dplyr operations using the pipe operator of the magrittr package. In the final section, the focus is on practicing how to subset your data using the group_by function, and how you can access data stored outside of R in a database. All said and done, you will be familiar with data manipulation tools and techniques that will allow you to efficiently manipulate data._

### Introduction to dplyr and tbls

_Introduction to the dplyr package and the tbl class. Learn the philosophy that guides dplyr, discover some useful applications of the dplyr package, and meet the data structures that dplyr uses behind the scenes._

### Load the dplyr and hflights package

Welcome to the interactive exercises part of your dplyr course. Here you will learn the ins and outs of working with dplyr. dplyr is an R package, a collection of functions and data sets that enhance the R language.

Throughout this course you will use dplyr to analyze a data set of airline flight data containing flights that departed from Houston. This data is stored in a package called hflights.

Both dplyr and hflights are already installed on DataCamp's servers, so loading them with library() will get you up and running.

### Instructions
Load the dplyr package.
Load the hflights package. A variable called hflights will become available, a data.frame representing the data set.
Use both head() and summary() on the hflights data frame to get to know the data. Can you guess the meaning of all variables?


```{r}
#Install package

#install.packages("dplyr")
#install.packages("hflights")
#install.packages("dbplyr")
#install.packages("RMySQL")
#install.packages("data.table")

# Load the dplyr package
library("dplyr")

# Load the hflights package
library("hflights")

library("dbplyr")
library("DBI")
library("RMySQL")
# Call both head() and summary() on hflights
head(hflights)
summary(hflights)

```

###Explore the data set

A data scientist must be familiar with his or her data. Experiment with the data set in the console and maybe try to generate some insightful plots. For your convenience, hflights is already loaded into the workspace.

How many observations and how many variables are contained in the hflights data set?

```{r}
hflights <- select(hflights, 1:21)
dim(hflights)
glimpse(hflights)

```

### Convert data.frame to tibble

As Garrett explained, a tbl (pronounced tibble) is just a special kind of data.frame. They make your data easier to look at, but also easier to work with. On top of this, it is straightforward to derive a tbl from a data.frame structure using tbl_df().

The tbl format changes how R displays your data, but it does not change the data's underlying data structure. A tbl inherits the original class of its input, in this case, a data.frame. This means that you can still manipulate the tbl as if it were a data.frame. In other words, you can do anything with the hflights tbl that you could do with the hflights data.frame.

Instructions
Convert hflights (which is a data.frame) into a tbl, also named hflights.
Display the new hflights in your console window. Notice the easy-to-read layout.
To see how tbls behave like data.frames, save the UniqueCarrier column of hflights as an object named carriers, using base R syntax only.
```{r}
#precode
rm(list = ls())
url <- "http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/dplyr/hflights.RData"
#download.file(url, "hflights.RData")

load("hflights.RData")
hflights <- as.data.frame(hflights)



```

```{r}
# Both the dplyr and hflights packages are loaded

# Convert the hflights data.frame into a hflights tbl
hflights <- tbl_df(hflights)

# Display the hflights tbl
hflights

# Create the object carriers
carriers <- hflights$UniqueCarrier

```

###Changing labels of hflights, part 1 of 2

A bit of cleaning would be a good idea since the UniqueCarrier variable of hflights uses a confusing code system.

To do this, let's work with a lookup table, that comes in the form of a named vector. When you subset the lookup table with a character string (like the character strings in UniqueCarrier), R will return the values of the lookup table that correspond to the names in the character string. To see how this works, run following code in the console:

two <- c("AA", "AS")
lut <- c("AA" = "American", 
         "AS" = "Alaska", 
         "B6" = "JetBlue")
two <- lut[two]
two
Instructions
Add a new Carrier column to hflights by combining lut with the UniqueCarrier column of hflights.
It's rather hard to see if you did things right, since the Carrier variable does not appear when you print hflights. Use the glimpse() function on hflights instead.


```{r}
# Both the dplyr and hflights packages are loaded into workspace
lut <- c("AA" = "American", "AS" = "Alaska", "B6" = "JetBlue", "CO" = "Continental", 
         "DL" = "Delta", "OO" = "SkyWest", "UA" = "United", "US" = "US_Airways", 
         "WN" = "Southwest", "EV" = "Atlantic_Southeast", "F9" = "Frontier", 
         "FL" = "AirTran", "MQ" = "American_Eagle", "XE" = "ExpressJet", "YV" = "Mesa")

# Add the Carrier column to hflights
hflights$Carrier <- lut[hflights$UniqueCarrier]

# Glimpse at hflights
glimpse(hflights)


```


###Changing labels of hflights, part 2 of 2

Let's try a similar thing, but this time to change the labels in the CancellationCode column. This column lists reasons why a flight was cancelled using a non-informative alphabetical code. Execute

unique(hflights$CancellationCode)
A lookup table lut has already been created for you, that converts the alphabetical codes into more meaningful strings.

Instructions
Use lut to change the labels of the CancellationCode column of hflights. Store the recoded vector in a new column Code.
As before, check your results by glimpsing at them.

```{r}

#pre exercise code

rm(hflights)

load("hflights.RData")

hflights$Carrier <- c("AA" = "American", "AS" = "Alaska", "B6" = "JetBlue", "CO" = "Continental",                              "DL" = "Delta", "OO" = "SkyWest", "UA" = "United", "US" = "US_Airways",
                      "WN" = "Southwest", "EV" = "Atlantic_Southeast", "F9" = "Frontier",
                      "FL" = "AirTran", "MQ" = "American_Eagle", "XE" = "ExpressJet", "YV" = "Mesa")[hflights$UniqueCarrier]

hflights$CancellationCode[nchar(hflights$CancellationCode) == 0] <- "E"

```





```{r}

# The hflights tbl you built in the previous exercise is available in the workspace.

# The lookup table
lut <- c("A" = "carrier", "B" = "weather", "C" = "FFA", "D" = "security", "E" = "not cancelled")

# Add the Code column
hflights$Code <- lut[hflights$CancellationCode]

# Glimpse at hflights
glimpse(hflights)


```

# Select and mutate

_Get familiar with dplyr's manipulation verbs. Meet the five verbs and then practice using the mutate and select verbs._



Comparison to base R

To see the added value of the dplyr package, it is useful to compare its syntax with base R. Up to now, you have only considered functionality that is also available without the use of dplyr. The elegance and ease-of-use of dplyr is a great plus though.

Instructions
Finish the select() calls to match the results of the base R commands. Try to make your calls as concise as possible.

```{r}
# both hflights and dplyr are available

# Finish select call so that ex1d matches ex1r
ex1r <- hflights[c("TaxiIn", "TaxiOut", "Distance")]
ex1d <- select(hflights, starts_with("TaxI"), Distance)
ex1d
# Finish select call so that ex2d matches ex2r
ex2r <- hflights[c("Year", "Month", "DayOfWeek", "DepTime", "ArrTime")]
ex2d <- select(hflights, Year:DayOfWeek, -3, DepTime, ArrTime)
ex2d
# Finish select call so that ex3d matches ex3r
ex3r <- hflights[c("TailNum", "TaxiIn", "TaxiOut")]
ex3d <- select(hflights, starts_with("Ta"))
ex3d
```



### Choosing is not losing! The select verb

To answer the simple question whether flight delays tend to shrink or grow during a flight, we can safely discard a lot of the variables of each flight. To select only the ones that matter, we can use select().
As an example, take the following call, that selects the variables var1 and var2 from the data frame df.
select(df, var1, var2)
You can also use : to select a range of variables and - to exclude some variables, similar to indexing a data.frame with square brackets. You can use both variable's names as well as integer indexes. This call selects the four first variables except for the second one of a data frame df:
select(df, 1:4, -2)
select() does not change the data frame it is called on; you have to explicitly assign the result of select() to a variable to store the result.

Instructions

	* Use select() to print out a tbl that contains only the columns ActualElapsedTime, AirTime, ArrDelay and DepDelay of hflights.
	* Print out a tbl with the columns Origin up to and including Cancelledof hflights.
	* Find the most concise way to select: columns Year up to and including DayOfWeek, columns ArrDelay up to and including Diverted. You can examine the order of the variables in hflights with names(hflights) in the console.

```{r}
# hflights is pre-loaded as a tbl, together with the necessary libraries.

# Print out a tbl with the four columns of hflights related to delay
select(hflights, ActualElapsedTime, AirTime, ArrDelay, DepDelay)

# Print out the columns Origin up to Cancelled of hflights
select(hflights, Origin:Cancelled)

# Answer to last question: be concise!
select(hflights, Year:DayOfWeek, ArrDelay:Diverted)



```


### Helper functions for variable selection

dplyr comes with a set of helper functions that can help you select groups of variables inside a select() call:

starts_with("X"): every name that starts with "X",
ends_with("X"): every name that ends with "X",
contains("X"): every name that contains "X",
matches("X"): every name that matches "X", where "X" can be a regular expression,
num_range("x", 1:5): the variables named x01, x02, x03, x04 and x05,
one_of(x): every name that appears in x, which should be a character vector.
Pay attention here: When you refer to columns directly inside select(), you don't use quotes. If you use the helper functions, you do use quotes.

Instructions
Use select() and a helper function to print out a tbl that contains just ArrDelay and DepDelay of hflights.
Use a combination of helper functions and variable names to print out only the UniqueCarrier, FlightNum, TailNum, Cancelled, and CancellationCode columns of hflights.
Find the most concise way to return the following columns with select and its helper functions: DepTime, ArrTime, ActualElapsedTime, AirTime, ArrDelay, DepDelay. Use only helper functions!


```{r}

url <- "http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/dplyr/hflights2.RData"
# download.file(url, "hflights2.RData")

load("hflights2.RData")


```


```{r}
# As usual, hflights is pre-loaded as a tbl, together with the necessary libraries.

# Print out a tbl containing just ArrDelay and DepDelay
select(hflights, ends_with("Delay"))

# Print out a tbl as described in the second instruction, using both helper functions and variable names
select(hflights, UniqueCarrier, contains("Cancell"), ends_with("Num"))

# Print out a tbl as described in the third instruction, using only helper functions.
select(hflights, ends_with("Delay"), ends_with("Time")) 


```


# hflights and dplyr are loaded and ready to serve you.

# Add the new variable ActualGroundTime to a copy of hflights and save the result as g1.
g1 <- mutate(hflights, ActualGroundTime = ActualElapsedTime - AirTime)

# Add the new variable GroundTime to g1. Save the result as g2.
g2 <- mutate(g1, GroundTime = TaxiIn + TaxiOut)

# Add the new variable AverageSpeed to g2. Save the result as g3.
g3 <- mutate(g2, AverageSpeed = Distance / AirTime * 60)

# Print out g3



```{r}
# hflights and dplyr are loaded and ready to serve you.

# Add the new variable ActualGroundTime to a copy of hflights and save the result as g1.
g1 <- mutate(hflights, ActualGroundTime = ActualElapsedTime - AirTime)

# Add the new variable GroundTime to g1. Save the result as g2.
g2 <- mutate(g1, GroundTime = TaxiIn + TaxiOut)

# Add the new variable AverageSpeed to g2. Save the result as g3.
g3 <- mutate(g2, AverageSpeed = Distance / AirTime * 60)

# Print out g3
g3
```



#Add multiple variables using mutate

So far you've added variables to hflights one at a time, but you can also use mutate() to add multiple variables at once. To create more than one variable, place a comma between each variable that you define inside mutate().

mutate() even allows you to use a new variable while creating a next variable in the same call. In this example, the new variable x is directly reused to create the new variable y:

mutate(my_df, x = a + b, y = x + c)
Instructions
Adapt the code that builds m1: add a variable loss_ratio, which is the ratio of loss to DepDelay.
Create a tbl m2 from hflights by adding three variables:
TotalTaxi, which is the sum of TaxiIn and TaxiOut;
ActualGroundTime, which is the difference of ActualElapsedTime and AirTime;
Diff, the difference between the two newly created variables. This column should be zero for all observations!

```{r}
# hflights and dplyr are ready, are you?

# Add a second variable loss_ratio to the dataset: m1
m1 <- mutate(hflights, loss = ArrDelay - DepDelay, loss_ratio = loss / DepDelay)
m1
# Add the three variables as described in the third instruction: m2
m2 <- mutate(hflights, TotalTaxi = TaxiIn + TaxiOut, ActualGroundTime = ActualElapsedTime - AirTime, Diff = TotalTaxi - ActualGroundTime)
m2
```

# Filter and arrange

_Learn how to search through the observations in your data set (and extract useful observations) with the filter function. Rearrange the observations in your data set with the arrange verb._

###Logical operators

R comes with a set of logical operators that you can use inside filter():

x < y, TRUE if x is less than y
x <= y, TRUE if x is less than or equal to y
x == y, TRUE if x equals y
x != y, TRUE if x does not equal y
x >= y, TRUE if x is greater than or equal to y
x > y, TRUE if x is greater than y
x %in% c(a, b, c), TRUE if x is in the vector c(a, b, c)
The following example filters df such that only the observations for which a is positive, are kept:

filter(df, a > 0)
Instructions
Print out all flights in hflights that traveled 3000 or more miles.
Print out all flights in hflights flown by JetBlue, Southwest, or Delta.
Extract from hflights all flights where taxiing took longer than the actual flight. Avoid the use of mutate() and do the math directly in the logical expression of filter().

```{r}
# hflights is at your disposal as a tbl, with clean carrier names

# All flights that traveled 3000 miles or more
filter(hflights, Distance >= 3000)

# All flights flown by one of JetBlue, Southwest, or Delta
filter(hflights, UniqueCarrier %in% c("JetBlue", "Southwest", "Delta"))

# All flights where taxiing took longer than flying
filter(hflights, TaxiIn + TaxiOut > AirTime)

```


###Combining tests using boolean operators

R also comes with a set of boolean operators that you can use to combine multiple logical tests into a single test. These include & (and), | (or), and ! (not). Instead of using the & operator, you can also pass several logical tests to filter(), separated by commas. The following two calls are completely equivalent:

filter(df, a > 0 & b > 0)
filter(df, a > 0, b > 0)
Next, is.na() will also come in handy. This example keeps the observations in df for which the variable x is not NA:

filter(df, !is.na(x))
Instructions
Use R's logical and boolean operators to select just the rows where a flight left before 5:00 am (500) or arrived after 10:00 pm (2200).
Print out all of the flights that departed late but arrived ahead of schedule. Use DepDelay and ArrDelay for this.
Find all of the flights that were cancelled after being delayed. These are flights that were cancelled, while having a DepDelay greater than zero.

```{r}
# hflights is at your service as a tbl!

# All flights that departed before 5am or arrived after 10pm
filter(hflights, ArrTime > 2200 | DepTime < 500 )

# All flights that departed late but arrived ahead of schedule
filter(hflights, DepDelay > 0, ArrDelay < 0 )

# All flights that were cancelled after being delayed
filter(hflights, DepDelay > 0, Cancelled == 1)

```


###Blend together what you've learned!

So far, you have learned three data manipulation functions in the dplyr package. Time for a summarizing exercise. You will generate a new dataset from the hflights dataset that contains some useful information on flights that had JFK airport as their destination. You will need select(), mutate() and filter().

Instructions
First, use filter() to select the flights that had JFK as their destination and save this result to c1.
Second, add a new column named Date to c1: paste() together the Year, Month and DayofMonth variables, separate them by a "-" by using the sep attribute of paste(). Save the resulting data frame as c2.
Finally, select some columns to provide an overview: Date, DepTime, ArrTime and TailNum, in this order. Do not assign the resulting data frame to a variable; just print it to the console.

```{r}
# hflights is already available in the workspace

# Select the flights that had JFK as their destination: c1
c1 <- filter(hflights, Dest == "JFK" )
c1
# Combine the Year, Month and DayofMonth variables to create a Date column: c2

c2 <- mutate(c1, Date = paste(Year, Month, DayofMonth, sep="-"))
c2
# Print out a selection of columns of c2
select(c2, Date, DepTime, ArrTime, TailNum)

```


Arranging your data

arrange() can be used to rearrange rows according to any type of data. If you pass arrange() a character variable, for example, R will rearrange the rows in alphabetical order according to values of the variable. If you pass a factor variable, R will rearrange the rows according to the order of the levels in your factor (running levels() on the variable reveals this order).

dtc has already been defined on the right. It's up to you to write some arrange() expressions to display its contents appropriately!

Instructions
Arrange dtc, by departure delays so that the shortest departure delay is at the top of the data set.
Arrange dtc so that flights that were cancelled for the same reason appear next to each other.
Arrange dtc so that flights by the same carrier appear next to each other. Within each carrier, flights that have smaller departure delays appear before flights that have higher departure delays. Do this in a one-liner.

```{r}
# dplyr and the hflights tbl are available

# Definition of dtc
dtc <- filter(hflights, Cancelled == 1, !is.na(DepDelay))

# Arrange dtc by departure delays
arrange(dtc, DepDelay)

# Arrange dtc so that cancellation reasons are grouped

arrange(dtc, CancellationCode)

# Arrange dtc according to carrier and departure delays
arrange (dtc, UniqueCarrier, DepDelay)


```


### Reverse the order of arranging

By default, arrange() arranges the rows from smallest to largest. Rows with the smallest value of the variable will appear at the top of the data set. You can reverse this behavior with the desc() function. arrange() will reorder the rows from largest to smallest values of a variable if you wrap the variable name in desc() before passing it to arrange().

Instructions
Arrange hflights so that flights by the same carrier appear next to each other and within each carrier, flights that have larger departure delays appear before flights that have smaller departure delays.
Arrange the flights in hflights by their total delay (the sum of DepDelay and ArrDelay). Try to do this directly inside arrange().



```{r}
# dplyr and the hflights tbl are available

# Arrange according to carrier and decreasing departure delays
arrange(hflights, UniqueCarrier, desc(DepDelay))

# Arrange flights by total delay (normal order).
df<- arrange(hflights, DepDelay + ArrDelay)

select(df, 12:13)

df1 <- mutate(df, Total= ArrDelay + DepDelay)

select(arrange(df1, Total),22)


```




# Summarise and the pipe operator

_Master the data manipulation verb summarise, and practice combining the five verbs to solve advanced data manipulation tasks. Learn to chain the operators together with the piping operator._

###The syntax of summarise

summarise(), the last of the 5 verbs, follows the same syntax as mutate(), but the resulting dataset consists of a single row instead of an entire new column in the case of mutate().

In contrast to the four other data manipulation functions, summarise() does not return an altered copy of the dataset it is summarizing; instead, it builds a new dataset that contains only the summarising statistics.

Instructions
Use summarise() to print out a summary of hflights containing two variables: min_dist, the shortest distance flown, and max_dist, the longest distance flown.
Print out a summary of hflights with a single variable, max_div: the longest Distance for diverted flights. You will need one of the four other verbs to do this!

```{r}
# hflights and dplyr are loaded in the workspace

# Print out a summary with variables min_dist and max_dist
summarise(hflights, min_dist = min(Distance), max_dist = max(Distance))

# Print out a summary with variable max_div
summarise(filter(hflights, Diverted == 1), max_div = max(Distance))

```


###Aggregate functions

You can use any function you like in summarise() so long as the function can take a vector of data and return a single number. R contains many aggregating functions, as dplyr calls them:

min(x) - minimum value of vector x.
max(x) - maximum value of vector x.
mean(x) - mean value of vector x.
median(x) - median value of vector x.
quantile(x, p) - pth quantile of vector x.
sd(x) - standard deviation of vector x.
var(x) - variance of vector x.
IQR(x) - Inter Quartile Range (IQR) of vector x.
diff(range(x)) - total range of vector x.
Instructions
Remove rows that have NAs in the arrival delay column and save the resulting dataset to temp1.
Print out a summary of temp1 with the following variables (in this order):
earliest: the minimum arrival delay,
average: the average arrival delay,
latest: the longest arrival delay,
sd: the standard deviation for arrival delays.
Filter hflights such that only rows that have no NA TaxiIn and no NA TaxiOut are kept; save this temporary result to temp2.
Print out a summary of temp2, with one variable, max_taxi_diff: the biggest absolute difference in time between TaxiIn and TaxiOut for a single flight.

```{r}
# hflights is available

# Remove rows that have NA ArrDelay: temp1
temp1 <- filter(hflights, !is.na(ArrDelay))

# Generate summary about ArrDelay column of temp1
summarise(temp1, earliest = min(ArrDelay), average = mean(ArrDelay), latest = max(ArrDelay), sd = sd(ArrDelay))

# Keep rows that have no NA TaxiIn and no NA TaxiOut: temp2
temp2 <- filter(hflights, !is.na(TaxiIn), !is.na(TaxiOut))

# Print the maximum taxiing difference of temp2 with summarise()
summarise(temp2, max_taxi_diff = max(abs(TaxiIn - TaxiOut)))


```


### dplyr aggregate functions

dplyr provides several helpful aggregate functions of its own, in addition to the ones that are already defined in R. These include:

first(x) - The first element of vector x.
last(x) - The last element of vector x.
nth(x, n) - The nth element of vector x.
n() - The number of rows in the data.frame or group of observations that summarise() describes.
n_distinct(x) - The number of unique values in vector x.
Next to these dplyr-specific functions, you can also turn a logical test into an aggregating function with sum() or mean(). A logical test returns a vector of TRUE's and FALSE's. When you apply sum() or mean() to such a vector, R coerces each TRUE to a 1 and each FALSE to a 0. sum() then represents the total number of observations that passed the test; mean() represents the proportion.

Instructions
Print out a summary of hflights with the following variables:
n_obs: the total number of observations,
n_carrier: the total number of carriers,
n_dest: the total number of destinations,
aa, a tbl with all flights flown by American Airlines, is already available.
Print out a summary of aa with the following variables:
n_flights: the total number of flights (each observation is a flight),
n_canc: the total number of cancelled flights,
avg_delay: the average arrival delay of flights whose delay is not NA (na.rm = TRUE).

```{r}

# hflights is available with full names for the carriers

# Generate summarizing statistics for hflights
summarise(hflights,
          n_obs = n(),
          n_carrier = n_distinct(UniqueCarrier),
          n_dest = n_distinct(Dest))

# All American Airline flights
aa <- filter(hflights, UniqueCarrier == "American")

# Generate summarizing statistics for aa 
summarise(aa,
          n_flights = n(),
          n_canc = sum(Cancelled == 1),
          avg_delay = mean(ArrDelay, na.rm = TRUE)
          )


```

### Overview of syntax

As another example of the %>%, have a look at the following two commands that are completely equivalent:

mean(c(1, 2, 3, NA), na.rm = TRUE)
c(1, 2, 3, NA) %>% mean(na.rm = TRUE)
The %>% operator allows you to extract the first argument of a function from the arguments list and put it in front of it, thus solving the Dagwood sandwich problem.

Instructions
Use dplyr functions and the pipe operator to transform the following English sentences into R code:

Take the hflights data set and then ...
Add a variable named diff that is the result of subtracting TaxiIn from TaxiOut, and then ...
Pick all of the rows whose diff value does not equal NA, and then ...
Summarise the data set with a value named avg that is the mean diff value.

```{r}

# hflights and dplyr are both loaded and ready to serve you

# Write the 'piped' version of the English sentences.
hflights %>% 
mutate(diff = TaxiOut - TaxiIn ) %>%
filter(!is.na(diff)) %>%
summarise(avg = mean(diff))

```


### Drive or fly? Part 1 of 2

You can answer sophisticated questions by combining the verbs of dplyr. Over the next few exercises you will examine whether it sometimes makes sense to drive instead of fly. You will begin by making a data set that contains relevant variables. Then, you will find flights whose equivalent average velocity is lower than the velocity when traveling by car.

In the following instructions, you have to carry out a series of dplyr verbs on the hflights dataset. Make sure to use the %>% operator to chain them all together.

Instructions
mutate() the hflights dataset and add two variables:
RealTime: the actual elapsed time plus 100 minutes (for the overhead that flying involves) and
mph: calculated as Distance / RealTime * 60, then
filter() to keep observations that have an mph that is not NA and that is below 70, finally
summarise() the result by creating four summary variables:
n_less, the number of observations,
n_dest, the number of destinations,
min_dist, the minimum distance and
max_dist, the maximum distance.


```{r}

# Chain together mutate(), filter() and summarise()
hflights %>%
mutate(RealTime = ActualElapsedTime + 100, mph = Distance/RealTime * 60) %>%
filter (!is.na(mph), mph < 70) %>%
summarise(n_less = n(),
          n_dest = n_distinct(Dest),
          min_dist = min(Distance),
          max_dist = max(Distance)
            )

```


### Drive or fly? Part 2 of 2

The previous exercise suggested that some flights might be less efficient than driving in terms of speed. But is speed all that matters? Flying imposes burdens on a traveler that driving does not. For example, airplane tickets are very expensive. Air travelers also need to limit what they bring on their trip and arrange for a pick up or a drop off. Given these burdens we might demand that a flight provide a large speed advantage over driving.

Let's define preferable flights as flights that are at least 50% faster than driving, i.e. that travel 105 mph or greater in real time. Also, assume that cancelled or diverted flights are less preferable than driving.

The mutate() call from the previous exercise is already coded up; can you add more pipes and verbs to the command?

Instructions
filter() the result of mutate to:
keep observations that have an mph under 105 or for which Cancelled equals 1 or for which Diverted equals 1.
summarise() the result by creating four summary variables:
n_non, the number of observations,
n_dest, the number of destinations,
min_dist, the minimum distance and
max_dist, the maximum distance.


```{r}
# Finish the command with a filter() and summarise() call
hflights %>%
  mutate(RealTime = ActualElapsedTime + 100, mph = Distance / RealTime * 60) %>%
  filter(mph < 105 | Cancelled == 1 | Diverted == 1) %>%
  summarise(n_non = n(),
          n_dest = n_distinct(Dest),
          min_dist = min(Distance),
          max_dist = max(Distance)
            )
  

```


### Advanced piping exercise

Let's use hflights to answer another question: How many flights were overnight flights?

Instructions
filter() the hflights tbl to keep only observations whose DepTime is not NA, whose ArrTime is not NA and for which DepTime exceeds ArrTime.
Pipe the result into a summarise() call to create a single summary variable: num, that simply counts the number of observations.

```{r}
# hflights and dplyr are loaded

# Count the number of overnight flights
hflights %>% 
filter(!is.na(DepTime), !is.na(ArrTime), DepTime > ArrTime) %>%
summarise(num= n())

```




# Group_by and working with databases

_Complete your mastery of data manipulation with group-wise operations and databases. Learn to use group_by to group your data into subsets of observations, and use dplyr to access data stored outside of R in a database._


### Unite and conquer using group_by

As Garrett explained, group_by() lets you define groups within your data set. Its influence becomes clear when calling summarise() on a grouped dataset: summarising statistics are calculated for the different groups separately.

In this exercise, you are going to create an ordered per-carrier summary of hflights by combining group_by(), summarise() and arrange().

Instructions
Use group_by() to group hflights by UniqueCarrier.
summarise() the grouped tbl with two summary variables:
p_canc, the percentage of cancelled flights
avg_delay, the average arrival delay of flights whose delay does not equal NA.
Finally, order the carriers in the summary from low to high by their average arrival delay. Use percentage of flights cancelled to break any ties.

```{r}

# hflights is in the workspace as a tbl, with translated carrier names

# Make an ordered per-carrier summary of hflights
hflights %>%
  group_by(UniqueCarrier) %>%
  summarise(p_canc = mean(Cancelled == 1 ) * 100,
            avg_delay = mean(ArrDelay, na.rm = TRUE) ) %>%
  arrange(avg_delay, p_canc)

```


### Combine group_by with mutate

You can also combine group_by() with mutate(). When you mutate grouped data, mutate() will calculate the new variables independently for each group. This is particularly useful when mutate() uses the rank() function, that calculates within-group rankings. rank() takes a group of values and calculates the rank of each value within the group, e.g.

rank(c(21, 22, 24, 23))
has output

[1] 1 2 4 3
As with arrange(), rank() ranks values from the smallest to the largest.

Instructions
filter() the hflights tbl to only keep observations for which ArrDelay is not NA and positive.
Use group_by() on the result to group by UniqueCarrier.
Next, use summarise() to calculate the average ArrDelay per carrier. Call this summary variable avg.
Feed the result into a mutate() call: create a new variable, rank, calculated as rank(avg).
Finally, arrange by this new rank variable

```{r}
# dplyr is loaded, hflights is loaded with translated carrier names

# Ordered overview of average arrival delays per carrier
hflights %>%
filter(!is.na(ArrDelay), ArrDelay > 0) %>%
group_by(UniqueCarrier) %>%
summarise( avg = mean(ArrDelay)) %>%
mutate(rank = rank(avg)) %>%
arrange(rank)


```


Advanced group_by exercises

By now you've learned the fundamentals of dplyr: the five data manipulation verbs and the additional group_by() function to discover interesting group-wise statistics. The next challenges are an all-encompassing review of the concepts you have learned about. We already provided you with a template of the piped call that can solve the exercises. Up to you to finish all dplyr calls! For simplicity, you can include cancelled flights in your answers, so you shouldn't filter based on the Cancelled column.

Instructions
How many airplanes flew to only one destination? The tbl you print out should have a single column, named nplanes and a single row.
Find the most visited destination for each carrier. The tbl you print out should contain four columns:
UniqueCarrier and Dest,
n, how often a carrier visited a particular destination,
rank, how each destination ranks per carrier. rank should be 1 for every row, as you want to find the most visited destination for each carrier.

```{r}
# dplyr and hflights (with translated carrier names) are pre-loaded

# How many airplanes only flew to one destination?
hflights %>%
  group_by(TailNum) %>%
  summarise(ndest = n_distinct(Dest)) %>%
  filter(ndest == 1) %>%
  summarise(nplanes = n())

# Find the most visited destination for each carrier
hflights %>%
  group_by(UniqueCarrier, Dest) %>%
  summarise(n=n()) %>%
  mutate(rank = rank(desc(n))) %>%
  filter(rank == 1)


```

### dplyr deals with different types

hflights2 is a copy of hflights that is saved as a data table. hflights2 was made available in the background using the following code:

library(data.table)
hflights2 <- as.data.table(hflights)
hflights2 contains all of the same information as hflights, but the information is stored in a different data structure. You can see this structure by typing hflights2 at the command line.

Even though hflights2 is a different data structure, you can use the same dplyr functions to manipulate hflights2 as you used to manipulate hflights.

Instructions
Use summarise() to calculate n_carrier, the total number of unique carriers in hflights2. Whether or not you use the pipe is up to you!

```{r}

load("hflights2.RData")
library(data.table)
hflights2 <- as.data.table(hflights)

# hflights2 is pre-loaded as a data.table

# Use summarise to calculate n_carrier
hflights2 %>%
summarise(n_carrier = n_distinct(UniqueCarrier))

```

### dplyr and mySQL databases

DataCamp hosts a mySQL database with data about flights that departed from New York City in 2013. The data is similar to the data in hflights, but it does not contain information about cancellations or diversions. With the tbl() function, we already created a reference to a table in this information.

Although nycflights is a reference to data that lives outside of R, you can use the dplyr commands on them as usual. Behind the scenes, dplyr will convert the commands to the database's native language (in this case, SQL), and return the results. This allows you to pull data that is too large to fit in R: only the fraction of the data that you need will actually be downloaded into R, which will usually fit into R without memory issues.

Instructions
Try to understand the code that creates nycflights, a reference to a MySQL table.
Use glimpse() to check out nycflights. Although nycflights is a reference to a tbl in a remote database, there is no difference in syntax. Look carefully: the variable names in nycflights differ from the ones in hflights!
Group nycflights data by carrier, then summarise() with two variables: n_flights, the number of flights flown by each carrier and avg_delay, the average arrival delay of flights flown by each carrier. Finally, arrange the carriers by average delay from low to high.

```{r}
# Set up a connection to the mysql database
my_db <- src_mysql(dbname = "dplyr", 
                   host = "courses.csrrinzqubik.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com", 
                   port = 3306, 
                   user = "student",
                   password = "datacamp")

# Reference a table within that source: nycflights
nycflights <- tbl(my_db, "dplyr")

# glimpse at nycflights
glimpse(nycflights)

# Ordered, grouped summary of nycflights
nycflights %>%
group_by(carrier) %>%
summarise(n_flights = n(),
          avg_delay = mean( arr_delay)
          ) %>%
arrange(avg_delay)       

```
